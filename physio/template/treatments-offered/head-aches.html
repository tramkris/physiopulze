                <p>Some of the most common headaches include:
                    <b>Tension headache:</b> Usually caused by tension in the muscles of the shoulder, 
                    neck or face, tension headaches usually give a sensation of pressure all the 
                    way around the head and can cause nausea and light sensitivity.
                    <br><b>Cervicogenic headaches:</b> These are caused by pain referred from tissues in the neck. 
                    They usually cause pain on one side of the head from the base of the skull to the 
                    temple of the eye and are aggravated by neck movements.
                    <br><br>In the case of tension headaches, our physiotherapist will relax and unlock the muscles, 
                    releasing the tension that is causing the pain. They will also look at lifestyle factors
                    that might be contributing to the problem, such as stress, and help you to manage these.
                    <br><br>For cervicogenic headaches, the goal will be to address the neck issue at the root 
                    of the problem. This could involve manipulation, massage or mobilisation. Our physiotherapist will 
                    likely teach you exercises to perform regularly, which will help to relieve the problem.
                    Poor posture is a common cause of cervicogenic headaches, our physiotherapist will also 
                    look at your posture and ask about your living/working space to address that problem.
