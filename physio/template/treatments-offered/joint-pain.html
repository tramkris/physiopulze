                <p>Peripheral joints include the joints in the upper and lower extremities, 
                    such as the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, hip, knee, ankle, and foot.
                    And they are not in the spine area. 
                    <br> <br> Peripheral joints can be injured through
                    trauma, degeneration(general wear and tear), repetitive activities, overuse and disease.  
                    Common injuries to peripheral joints include dislocations, subluxations, sprains,
                    strains, tears, inflammatory conditions like rotator cuff tendonitis and degenerative 
                    conditions like arthritis.
                    <br> <br> Physiotherapy for joint pain offers diverse strategies to relieve joint pain 
                    by targeting the root cause and enhancing joint function. The treatment's effectiveness 
                    lies in its personalized approach, addressing specific joint issues while considering
                    individual needs. The combination of exercises, therapies and education empowers 
                    individuals to actively manage their joint health, offering sustained relief 
                    and improved joint function.
